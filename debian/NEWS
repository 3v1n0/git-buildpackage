git-buildpackage (0.3.3) unstable; urgency=low

  As of this version git-buildpackage doesn't pass hardcoded '-i\.git -I.git'
  to the build command specified via --git-builder (or via the builder config
  file options). So if you're not using the default build command (which is
  now 'debuild -i\.git -I.git' instead of just plain 'debuild') you'll have to
  add these options to your build command in order to exclude git metadata
  from your diffs and source tarballs.
  This was done to make the invocation of the build command more flexible, we
  don't rely on debuild behaviour from now on.
  Again: if you didn't change the default build command, you don't have to
  change anything.

  Generated tags are now by default put into debian/ and upstream/ namespaces.
  This doesn't have any effect on already existing tags.
