- git-buildpackage:
  - allow to export the hole source tree to tmpdir before building
- git-import-orig:
  - don't use git_load_dirs but use new branches for new upstream versions
    and merge them to 'upstream' - this will trace renames, etc. properly
  - allow to import from an unpacked source tree
- git-import-dsc:
  - allow to import into a git repository for backports
