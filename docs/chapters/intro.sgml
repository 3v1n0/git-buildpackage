      Welcome to &git-buildpackage;, a system that integrates the
      <ulink url="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</ulink> package build
      system with <ulink url="http://git.or.cz/">Git</ulink>.

	<title>Repository Layout</title>
	<para>
	Since &git; knows about branches (and in fact handles them very well)
	the git repository usually looks like: a so called
	<emphasis>master</emphasis> branch (the default branch) holds your
	current development work. Another branch called
	<emphasis>upstream</emphasis> holds the upstream sources. Other
	branches like <emphasis>nmu</emphasis> or
	<emphasis>dfsg_free</emphasis> might help with certain kinds of
	packages.  Git-Buildpackage currently only works with your local
	git-repository, in order to publish your changes simply use
	<command>git-push</command>.

    <title>Workflow</title>
    <para>
    	A typical workflow consists of the following steps:
    </para>
    <orderedlist>
	<listitem><para>Import a Debian package via &git-import-dsc;. This
	imports the &debian; Package on the master branch and the upstream
	sources on the upstream branch.</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>Develop, test, commit changes. During this time you can
	always build the package with &git-buildpackage; In case you have
	uncommitted changes in your source tree you can use the
	<option>--git-ignore-new</option> option.</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>Once satisfied you can build the final package with
	&git-buildpackage; <option>--git-tag</option>. This
	additionally creates a tag within &git; so you can switch back to that
	version later at any time.</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>When a new upstream version is released you can import
	this via &git-import-orig; onto the upstream branch.
	&git-import-orig; will also try to merge the new upstream version onto
	the master branch. After resolving any potential conflicts go back to 2.
	</para></listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    <para>These steps will be explaind in more details in the following sections.</para>
