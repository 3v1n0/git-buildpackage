    <para>Imporing an already exsting debian package into a git repository is as easy as:
    <screen>
&git-import-dsc; package_0.1-1.dsc

    This will put the upstream sources onto the <option>upstream</option>
    branch and the debian patch on the <option>master</option> branch. In case
    of a debian native package only the <option>master</option> branch is being
    used.

    <title>Upstream sources on a branch</title>
    <para>
    If the upstream sources are already on a separate branch things are pretty
    simple. You can either rename that branch to <emphasis>upstream</emphasis>
    with:
    <screen>
mv .git/theupstream-branch .git/upstream
    </screen> 
    or you can tell &git-buildpackage; the name of the branch:
    <screen>
cat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt; <filename>.git/gbp.conf</filename>
[DEFAULT]
# this is the upstream-branch:
upstream-branch=theupstream-branch
    </screen>
    If you use &git-import-orig; to import new upstream sources, they will
    end up on <emphasis>theupstream-branch</emphasis> and merged to
    <emphasis>master</emphasis>.
    </para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2>
    <title>Upstream sources not on a branch</title>
    <para>
    If you don't have an upstream branch but started you repository with only
    the upstream sources (not the debian patch) you can simply branch from that
    point. So use &gitkcmd; or &gitcmd;-log to locate the commit-id of that commit
    and create the upstream branch from there, e.g.:
<screen>
    COMMIT_ID=`&gitcmd; log --pretty=oneline | tail -1 | awk '{ print $1 }'`
    &gitcmd; branch upstream $COMMIT_ID
</screen>
    The important thing here is that the <envar>COMMIT_ID</envar> specifies a
    point on the master branch that carried <emphasis>only</emphasis> the
    upstream sources and not the debian modifications. The above example
    assumes that this was the first commit to that repository.
    </para>
    <warning><para>There's currently no easy way to use &git-import-orig; with
    a repository that never had the upstream sources as a single commit. Using
    it on such repositories might lead to unexpected merge results. You can use
    <command>git_load_dirs</command> instead.</para></warning>
