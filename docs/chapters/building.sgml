    <title>Building packages from the &git; repository</title>
    <para>
    In order to build a &debian; package from the &git; repository you use:
    &git-buildpackage;. During the development phase (when you're either not
    on the <emphasis>master</emphasis>-branch or when you have uncommitted
    changes in your repository) you'll usually use:
<screen>
&git-buildpackage; <option>--git-ignore-new</option>
</screen>
    Once you're satisfied with the build and want to do a relese you commit all
    you changes and issue:
<screen>
&git-buildpackage; <option>--git-tag</option>
</screen>
    This will again build the debian package and tag the final result after
    extracting the current version from the changelog. If you want &gpg; signed
    tags you can use the <option>--git-sign</option> and
    <option>--git-keyid</option> options.
